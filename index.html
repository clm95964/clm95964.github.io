  <h5 style= "font-size: 175%">2017 Season and Offseason Turmoil</h5>
<p style="color:red; font-family:Times New Roman"> Last year, with the opening of Suntrust Stadium in Atlanta along with many rated as the best farm system in Major League Baseball as well as a veteran pitching staff lead by R.A. Dickey brought hope for a good and successful season. However, this would not be the case as the farm system players were not quite ready and veteran pitching staff failed to produce adequate numbers. The 2017 Atlanta Braves finished with a 72-90 record good for third place in the National League East division but a staggering 25 games behind the division winning Washington Nationals. The offseason proved to provide even more devastation for the organization as the organizations General Manager John Coppolella was given a lifetime ban for breaking of international signing rules of mostly Latin American players. Along with his ban the contracts of many top international Latin American prospects acquired by the Braves had to be nullified.

  <h2 style="color:ghostwhite">2018 Optimism</h2>
  <p style="color:blue">
   With 2018 comes a new sense of hope around the Atlanta Braves organization. The dark times of 2017 are behind us and things can only get better. The Atlanta Braves still have one of the top rated farm systems in all of Major League Baseball and those young players are now a full year older and have that year of experience under their belt. At the time of this writing the Braves have already won their opening game against the rival Philadelphia Phillies in dramatic walk off fashion with a home run by veteran Nick Markakis to win 8-5. While no one is predicting the Braves to topple the Nationals on top of the division this year should bring improvement and the ability to compete for a wild card spot late into the season. This team may still be a year away but I expect an improved record of 82-80.

  <h5 style= "font-size: 160%; color:ghostwhite">Player Spotlight: Freddie Freeman</h5>
  <p style="color:black">
    Freddie Freeman has been a staple of the Atlanta Braves organization since he came to the Majors and the first basement has established himself as a now perenial MVP candidate. A lifetime Atlanta Brave he was drafted by the organization in 2007 out of high school from his native California. Last year a wrist injury knocked him out of the MVP race while he was on pace with phenominal numbers. Expectations this year are sky high for Freeman as he is without a doubt the Braves best and most important player on the roster
